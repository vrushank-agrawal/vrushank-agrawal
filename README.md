### Polytechnique Courses :

- I have added many of my Polytechnique courses on Github. 
- These contain the usual material such as TDs or projects. 
- I have tried to keep them as complete as possible for future reference for anyone.
- The questions might change over the years (quite unlikely) but these repos can still be accessed for general understanding.
